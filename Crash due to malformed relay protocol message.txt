Crash due to malformed relay protocol message: - CVE-2021-21404 -
 (github.com/syncthing/syncthing)

syncthing can be caused to crash and exit if sent a malformed relay
protocol message message with a negative length field.

The relay server strelaysrv can be caused to crash and exit if sent
a malformed relay protocol message with a negative length field.

At no point is sensitive data exposed or liable to be altered due to this
issue. Sensitive data is never exposed to relay operators. Syncthing itself
would need to be lured to connect to a malicious relay server in order to
exploit the issue.

Patches
Fixed in version 1.15.0.

Workarounds
No known workaround for strelaysrv.

syncthing can be configured to not use relays, or to only use specific,
trusted relays. If Syncthing is used in a closed environment or with
relaying disabled, i.e., it does not communicate with unknown relays,
Syncthing is not vulnerable.
